This project involves two main tasks:

Chronological Dating(ameros.py):

Objective: Predict the exact date of ancient Greek inscriptions using a neural network.
Data: 2,802 inscriptions from the PHI database with text transcriptions and date ranges.
Approach: Preprocess text (tokenization, TF-IDF), develop and train a neural network model, and evaluate performance.

Restoration(bmeros.py):

Objective: Restore partially damaged inscriptions using a Genetic Algorithm (GA).
Approach: Use GA to predict missing words based on similar inscriptions from the same region and evaluate restoration accuracy through cosine similarity.
The project integrates neural networks for dating and genetic algorithms for text restoration, advancing methods for analyzing and preserving ancient texts.
